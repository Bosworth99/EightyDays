# Eighty-Days

Eighty-Days is a half-concieved, half-built Flash game that I worked on in about 2008. 

The idea was that you would start on one side of the globe, and work your way through a map of cities, on an upgradable airship. Presumably, there would be things to do along the way. There is a market / commodity system, a la Dopewars. And you can configure an avatar. And there is no end screen. lol. 

I wrote all the code and did a bunch of the UI. My friend Phil worked on some of the assets, like the splash screen and the character components. And it was all Chris' bright idea (game mechanics et al). We spent several months tinkering with it, and got about half way into it. The next thing to be built was a quest system, that involved characters picked up in the tavern. If memory serves, we were going to have dynamically built cities, with all of Phil's cool assets, but never got that far. 

You can probably play it if you drag the swf in teh /bin into a browser. I think. 

Kinda miss the ol flash days. lol.
